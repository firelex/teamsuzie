# Extension model

Team Suzie is designed to be extended, not forked. This doc lists the seams you can hook into without modifying core packages.

Some extension points are richer than others. Check the corresponding package
README for implementation status before building against an interface.

## 1. Skills

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` (the instructions the agent reads when the skill is installed) and optional support files. To publish a skill:

1. Create a directory under `packages/skills/templates/<your-skill>`.
2. Write `SKILL.md`. It's plain Markdown with `{{variable}}` placeholders that the runtime fills at install time from agent-scoped config.
3. Add a `skill.json` manifest describing name, version, required config keys, and dependencies on other skills.

Skills do not execute code at install time; they only inject files. If your skill needs network access or side effects, those happen through the agent's tool surface at runtime, not through the skill installer.

Skill discovery can come from more than one source. The core package exposes a
`SkillSource` interface for local folders, community catalogs, or hosted
catalogs. The built-in `FilesystemSkillSource` wraps the normal
`packages/skills/templates` directory and marks those skills as free. The
built-in `HttpSkillSource` consumes an external catalog with:

```text
GET /skills
GET /skills/:slug
```

`apps/examples/skill-catalog-host` is a minimal implementation of that external
catalog contract. HTTP catalogs return raw template contents; the OSS
`HttpSkillSource` renders placeholders locally so agent context does not have to
be sent to the remote host.

Apps can also provide a `SkillInstallPolicy` before applying a source-backed
skill. The OSS default policy allows every install. Hosted Team Suzie can plug
in an entitlement service that denies paid skills, returns a checkout URL, or
serves only the bundles an org is allowed to install.

**Out of scope:** pricing, billing, paid-access enforcement, and hosted catalog
business rules. Those are hosted-product concerns. The OSS runtime knows how to
ask a policy for an install decision; it does not know why a commercial policy
allowed or denied access.

## 2. Approval dispatchers

The approval queue is generic: an agent proposes an action, a human approves, a dispatcher carries it out. To add a new action type:

1. Implement the `ApprovalDispatcher<T>` interface from `@teamsuzie/approvals`.
2. Register it by action type in your app's startup code.
3. The queue UI automatically surfaces any registered action type.

The ships-by-default email dispatcher (SendGrid) is a reference implementation.

## 3. LLM providers

Providers live in `apps/platform/llm-proxy/src/config.ts`. Each one is a `{ apiBase, apiKeyEnv }` entry in the `PROVIDERS` record, and the `resolveModel()` function routes an incoming model string to a provider — either via an explicit `provider/model-name` prefix or a heuristic branch on the bare model name.

To add a new OpenAI-compatible provider:

1. Add an entry to `PROVIDERS`:

   ```typescript
   export const PROVIDERS: Record<string, ProviderConfig> = {
     // …existing entries…
     myprovider: {
       apiBase: 'https://api.myprovider.example/v1',
       apiKeyEnv: 'MYPROVIDER_API_KEY',
     },
   };
   ```

2. Add a heuristic branch to `resolveModel()` so callers can pass bare model names:

   ```typescript
   if (lower.startsWith('myprovider-')) return { provider: 'myprovider', model };
   ```

3. Document `MYPROVIDER_API_KEY` in `.env.example`.

Callers can always bypass the heuristic by sending the explicit prefix form — e.g. `model: "myprovider/some-model"` — so the heuristic branch is a convenience, not a requirement.

Providers are assumed to speak the OpenAI Chat Completions wire format (`POST /chat/completions`, `POST /embeddings`, etc.). Non-OpenAI-compatible providers need a dedicated route handler; that's a larger change and out of scope for a simple provider addition.

Usage tracking is automatic — `completions.ts`, `responses.ts`, and `embeddings.ts` extract `usage` from the upstream response and publish it to Redis via `publishUsage()` regardless of which provider served the request.

## 4. Vector and graph backends

Both `apps/platform/vector-db` and `apps/platform/graph-db` wrap a concrete backend behind an HTTP API. To swap the backend:

1. Fork the corresponding app.
2. Replace the Milvus / Neo4j driver usage with your backend of choice.
3. Preserve the public HTTP contract (scope-aware search, insert, delete).

The db-client package doesn't care which backend you run — it only sees the HTTP API.

## 5. Auth providers

The `apps/platform/auth` service is session + email-based out of the box. For SSO, OAuth, or SAML:

1. Add a new route handler alongside the existing `/login` and `/signup`.
2. On successful external auth, create or find the user via the existing `UserService`.
3. Issue a session the same way the local-password flow does.

The cookie / CSRF layer is agnostic to how the user proved identity.

## What you cannot extend

- **Scope semantics.** `global / org / agent` is load-bearing across packages. Adding a new scope level is a breaking change, not a plugin.
- **Agent identity.** One agent = one org + one API key. Multi-org agents are a different data model.
- **The approval state machine.** States are deliberately few. If you need fine-grained workflow states, build them on top.

These are the axioms the rest of the system rests on. If you feel pressure to change them, that's usually a sign the feature belongs in a different system, not Team Suzie.
