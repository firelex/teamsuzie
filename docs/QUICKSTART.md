# Quickstart

Gets you from zero to a running agent hitting a scoped knowledge base with an approval queue in front of it.

## Prerequisites

- Node 22+
- pnpm 9+
- Docker + Docker Compose
- ~8 GB free RAM (Milvus + Neo4j are not light)

## 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firelex/teamsuzie
cd teamsuzie
pnpm install
```

## 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
# Defaults for Postgres/Redis/Milvus/Neo4j match the docker-compose below.
```

## 3. Start infrastructure

```bash
pnpm docker:up
```

This brings up Postgres, Redis, Milvus (with etcd + minio), and Neo4j. First start takes 1–2 minutes while images pull and Milvus initialises.

Verify:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml ps
```

## 4. Start the platform services

In separate terminals (or use a process manager like [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs)):

```bash
pnpm dev:auth         # :3005
pnpm dev:llm-proxy    # :4000
pnpm dev:vector-db    # :3006
pnpm dev:graph-db     # :3007
pnpm dev:admin        # API :3008, UI :5175
```

### Optional: get a bearer token for a mobile / Flutter / standalone client

Once `auth` is running, you can issue a client token with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Flow: bearer' \
  -d '{
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "password": "your-password",
    "issue_bearer_token": true,
    "token_name": "flutter-dev"
  }'
```

That returns a one-time `access_token` you can use as:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## 5. Create an org and an agent

Open the admin UI at [http://localhost:5175](http://localhost:5175). Sign in with the demo credentials shown on the login page, or sign up with any email in OSS dev mode. Create an agent and copy the API key it gives you.

## Troubleshooting

**Milvus fails to start:** give Docker more memory (≥6 GB).

**`COOKIE_SECRET must be set`:** your `.env` is not being loaded. Confirm you copied `.env.example → .env` at the repo root, and that the service you're starting reads env from there.

**Auth service can't reach Postgres:** wait ~10s after `docker:up` — Postgres takes a moment to accept connections. Or check `docker compose ... logs postgres`.

**Port already in use:** another service is already bound to 3005/3006/3007/3008/4000. Override via env (`PORT=3105 pnpm dev:auth`).
